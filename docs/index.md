# Welcome to the Galaxy!

Welcome to **Galaxy.sh**, a simple, fast, and private Linux container hosting service.

!!! example "Heads up"
    **Galaxy.sh** is in an *alpha-beta state*, and is continually being worked on. You may find options and settings changing. This documentation will also change and update frequently. We'll try not to break anything, but you may not yet want to host anything mission-critical.

    You can always check the [:material-check-all: Changelog](changelog/changelog.md) to see what we've done and the [:material-road: Roadmap](changelog/roadmap.md) to see what we're working on.

    If anything's broken, reach out to  [:fontawesome-regular-life-ring: Support](contact/contact-support.md) and we'll get you taken care of, post-haste.

    Help us squash bugs as we build by [:material-bug: Reporting Bugs](contact/bugs.md).

    Thanks for growing with us!
