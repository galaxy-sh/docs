# DMCA & Copyright Infringement Notifications
As described in our Terms of Service [Prohibited Uses section](terms.md/#prohibited-uses-of-services), you can't use our Services to distribute content which infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others.

## Notification of Copyright Infringement Claims
Are you a copyright owner? Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. ยง 512), you have the right to notify us (Galaxy.sh and Black Cat Labs LLC) if you believe that a user of our Services has infringed on your work(s) as copyright owner. To be effective, the notification of claimed infringement must be written.

Please include the following information in your claim:

-   A physical or electronic signature of the holder of the infringed copyright or the holder's authorized agent. Signatures must be a physical signature or an electronic signature in a recognized and industry-standard format that we can verify (e.g. PGP, DocuSign, Adobe certification). Unsigned notifications or notifications with unverifiable digital signatures will not be processed.
-   Clear and specific identification of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed.
-   Clear and specific identification of the exact location (URL), nature, and extent of each instance of allegedly infringing content sufficient for us to locate the specific material. It is usually not sufficient to simply identify a site by name or base URL.
-   Sufficient contact information for the copyright owner and, if applicable, the copyright holder's authorized agent. Email address is preferred but a telephone number or mailing address are also acceptable.
-   A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
-   A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
   

## DMCA Counter-Notifications
If you are a member of our Services and believe your material has been removed in error, we allow and encourage the use of the "counter-notification" process when material is incorrectly identified as infringing.

Please include the following information in your counter-notification:

-   An identification of the allegedly infringing material and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
-   Your name and contact information.
-   The following statement: `Under penalty of perjury, I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification. I will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under S.512(c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.`
-   One of the following statements:
    -   If your address is in the United States: `I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located.`
    -   If your address is **not** in the United States: `I consent to the jurisdiction of any United States judicial district in which Black Cat Labs LLC may be found.` (For your reference, this will typically be either the Ohio Northern District Court in Cleveland, OH, or the Wyoming District Court in Casper, WY. Both are US Federal District Courts.)
-   Your physical or electronic signature, or the signature of a person authorized to act on your behalf.
