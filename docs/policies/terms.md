# Terms of Service

## Intro
Our Terms of Service can be (very) briefly summarized as:

"We promise to always try to do the right thing. If you do too, it'll all be cool."

Please report any violations of our Terms of Service at [:octicons-shield-16: Reporting Abuse](../contact/abuse.md). Due to our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md), we may not be able to give you much information about any action we take in response to your report, but we will give it full consideration.

## Awareness
Black Cat Labs LLC ("Black Cat Labs", "Galaxy.sh", we/us) provides certain content and infrastructure hosting services ("Service", "Services") to you, subject to these Terms of Service ("Terms", "TOS"). The Terms apply to your use of our services whether or not you like or agree with them, and whether or not you take the time to fully digest them.

We may change these Terms or make new Terms at any time. Although we will attempt to notify you through reasonable means when the Terms change, we are under no obligation to do so.

You can always find the latest Terms at this web address, and can view revisions on our [:material-github: GitHub Repo](https://github.com/galaxy-sh/docs/blob/main/docs/policies/terms.md).

## Registration
Galaxy.sh memberships are held by individuals. This leads to three important notes:  

-   **You may only have one membership.** (You can, however, utilize our Projects[^1] to separate your resources and instances for different uses.)
-   **You may not create a membership for anyone other than yourself.** (If you wish to share resources and instances with another person, **they** can create a membership and you can then share Projects[^1] with them.)
-   **No one but you may access your membership.** (If you wish to share resources and instances with another person, **they** can create a membership and you can then share Projects[^1] with them.)  

You must provide accurate, complete, and current information about yourself as needed for registration and payment ("Registration Information"). In the event of a change, you must promptly update the Registration Information to ensure that it remains accurate, complete, and current.

In certain cases, to protect our Services, networks, and infrastructure from threat actors[^2], we may conduct additional identity verification ("Know Your Customer", "KYC") when you attempt to register or make use of our Services.

Black Cat Labs and Galaxy.sh will handle Registration Information and KYC Information in accordance with a published privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") available here: [Privacy Policy](privacy.md).

## Refunds
We want you to be happy with our service. However, we understand that it is not for everyone. We offer a very flexible refund policy in keeping with our belief that you should be able to try things out without taking a big risk.

We will refund the unused balance of your account(s) and close your membership at any time upon request.

We typically issue refunds through the same method that you used to pay. If this is not possible (e.g., due to time limits on refunds imposed by our payment processors), we will try to offer you a variety of refund options, some of which may carry a fee based on the cost.

Refunds can be requested by [contacting support](../contact/contact-support.md).

## Non-Refundable Credit
There are certain actions you can take that will convert your balance into a non-refundable credit. Also, we may offer incentives or bonuses in the form of non-refundable credits.

Non-refundable credits cannot be refunded (hence the name). If you have a nonrefundable credit in your account when you close it, we will donate an amount equivalent to that credit to a charity of your (or our) choice.

We will not ordinarily convert any balance to a nonrefundable credit except as needed to fulfill your requests. Before we do so, we will prominently notify you that your request will affect your eligibility for a refund and we will obtain your consent.

**Under no circumstances (except as required by law) will we ever accept money from one party and pay it out to another party.**

## Payment Practices
We charge your payment method only at your request and only with your authorization. If you submit a payment method as payment, you warrant to us that you have provided true and accurate information and that you are fully authorized to use that payment method.

As described in the [Refunds section](#refunds), we have a very flexible refund policy. Therefore, there should be no reason to ever file a chargeback or dispute. We investigate all such requests as potential fraud, and are required to freeze all affected accounts while the investigation is in progress. Because of the time and expense incurred in responding to a chargeback request, we charge a fee of up to $25.00 per occurrence. This fee will be waived if we find the chargeback is legitimate or due to an error on our part.

We do not keep payment information above and beyond the minimum amount necessary (which may include your name, billing address, the last four digits of the card number, and/or charge/payment identifiers) to identify transactions. This means we can never charge you for other transactions unless you explicitly log in and provide your card information.

Should you commit payment fraud of any kind in conjunction with our service, we will wreak dreadful vengeance upon you to the fullest extent of the law.

## Content
You are solely responsible for any and all information, literature, software, works of art, or any other materials ("Content") you make available using the Services.

-   violates the laws of the United States of America or Germany

You are responsible for making regular backups of your data and/or instance. These backups should be stored outside of our Services. Any backup Services provided by us should not be relied upon as the sole backup of your data/instance.

It is your sole responsibility to secure your Content and Instances and to restore them in the event of a system failure.

You will remain liable for any additional damages you cause Galaxy.sh/Black Cat Labs by your violation of these Terms. Please respect our Terms of Service.

Your *sole remedy regardless of the circumstances* shall be the return of funds contained in your account(s) that have not been disbursed or allocated to pay for Services provided or liquidated damages.**

## Exclusions and Limitations

The Terms and the relationship between you and Galaxy.sh/Black Cat Labs shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The failure of Galaxy.sh/Black Cat Labs to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

The section titles in the Terms are for clarity only and have no legal or contractual effect.

    *"The exit relay is the final relay in a Tor circuit, the one that sends traffic out to its destination. The services Tor clients are connecting to (website, chat service, email provider, etc) will see the IP address of the exit relay instead of the real IP address of the Tor user."*

    Black Cat Labs and Galaxy.sh are strong proponents of internet privacy and freedom. Unfortunately, we cannot support running Tor exit nodes at this time, in order to protect our IP reputation.

    We hope to revisit this topic in the future.
