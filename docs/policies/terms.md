# Terms of Service

## Intro
Our Terms of Service can be (very) briefly summarized as:

"We promise to always try to do the right thing. If you do too, it'll all be cool."

Please report any violations of our Terms of Service at [:octicons-shield-16: Reporting Abuse](../contact/abuse.md). Due to our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md), we may not be able to give you much information about any action we take in response to your report, but we will give it full consideration.
