# About
Nobody likes rules, but we do have a few you should be aware of, to keep this ship afloat.

Our [Terms of Service](terms.md) are the core rules that govern our members' relationship with us and are the final word on most "can and can't" issues.

Our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md) covers what information we collect about you and how we (don't) use it.

We provide information about our [Abuse handling policies](abuse.md) as well as our [DMCA guidelines](dmca.md).
